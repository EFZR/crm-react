# crm-react

## Project Description

The project has the purpose to learn the React framework, using react-router-dom to create a single page application with multiple routes.
The project uses the css framework tailwindcss to create the styles of the components.
We simulate an API with JSON Server, to create a database with the information of the clients.
Honestly this are my first projects where I use React, react-router-dom, tailwindcss and JSON Server, very good tools to create a web application, A project with good things to learn, so I invite you to see the code and if you want to use it, you can clone the repository and use it as you want.
